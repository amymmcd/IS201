<span class="poemtitle">inside the walls</span>
<span class="poemdate">5.11.20</span>

It wasn’t just that we could no longer step into the outside world. 
It was that we had never seen the insides of our own homes 
with such stark clarity. The walls were closer than we remembered, 
the ceilings higher. 
We had not noticed that stain on the carpet, 
that scratch in the paint. 
There were more noises, too— the dog’s breathing, 
the mess of voices floating down the stairs, 
the incessant tapping of fingers on keyboards. 
The people were closer together, but somehow farther apart, too, 
everyone so occupied with what we were missing 
that sometimes we forgot to enjoy what we were getting. 
There were more microwave beeps and more doors opening 
and more dishes in the sink and more stubbed toes 
and anxious piano songs and computer screens and sighs of exhaustion. 
Sometimes we couldn’t stand the details 
and sometimes we couldn’t handle the nothingness of it all. 
But every morning we woke up, 
and every night we went to bed, 
and one day we realized that there was 
a strange sort of beauty to this world inside the walls, 
one we hadn’t taken the time to see before.
                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
<span class="poemtitle">wilderness</span>
<span class="poemdate">12.10.17</span>

Crushed pine needles
A blanket of sunlight and smoke
Sweat against the cold
Dirt under fingernails
Dusty air in lungs
Songs swirling in the wind
Wildflowers and poison ivy
Aching muscles
Mountains to climb






<span class="poemtitle">queen</span>
<span class="poemdate">1.9.18</span>

Sungolden cathedrals
Alabaster caverns
Heartbeat in the ground.






<span class="poemtitle">emily</span>
<span class="poemdate">1.9.18</span> 

She saw her words as living
As breathing
As human.
I do not worship,
Only relate.
The deepest part
Of her soul
That she could not speak
Out loud,
She wrote.
Now, her soul is read.
Dissected.
Examined.
Deciphered.
Criticized.
Some praise, 
But others denounce.
I wonder,
If they knew
That my soul 
Was on paper,
Would they 
Desecrate it
Too?






<span class="poemtitle">noise</span>
<span class="poemdate">5.23.18</span> 

They speed down the road
Pumping electric music through their machines
But I walk in the rain
Under a symphony of filtered sunlight.






<span class="poemtitle">confused</span>
<span class="poemdate">11.24.18</span>

I’ve heard that your heart is your map
That it will tell you where to go
And what do to
And who to love
But every time I look at my heart
All I see is a tangle of string,
A tired mess gasping for air
And when I try to follow it
I forget where it was
That I wanted to go






<span class="poemtitle">to you, when i find you</span>
<span class="poemdate">11.24.18</span>

I love your squinty-eyed smile
And the way you never look as good in photos
As you do in real life
I love your laugh
Because it makes me laugh
Even when nothing is funny
I love your voice
And how it wavers when you sing
And falters when you cry
I love your hands
Because when they touch mine
They remind me that you are even better than a dream
I love your name
Simply because it is yours
I love you
Because you know that I like wildflowers
And paper snowflakes
And words
And you understand how I think 
And you know when to talk
And when to leave me alone
And you know when I’m sad
And you listen
And you love me even when I don’t love myself
And you never leave without hugging me
And maybe you aren’t perfect
But you are good
And you are kind






<span class="poemtitle">here’s why</span>
<span class="poemdate">11.24.18</span>

I write 
Because I like the way that pretty words sound
And how ink looks on paper






<span class="poemtitle">shoes</span>
<span class="poemdate">3.8.19</span>

I have found that I prefer the ugly tears 
that leave scratches on my heart 
to the dead laughs that slip so easily from my mouth 
only to leave an awkward feeling staring me in the face 
until I hang my chin 
and rigorously examine my once-white shoes.






<span class="poemtitle">heartbreak</span>
<span class="poemdate">3.9.19</span>

You broke her heart on Thursday, in a parking lot.
But really, you broke your own heart—
Hers is too pretty to bleed for long. 

I confess, I wish you had done it sooner,
before I gave up, before you had lost your sincerity 
to the joking confidence that is only freckle-deep. 

But I don’t blame you. 
She talks more and laughs easily and smiles for all she sees. 
She does it better than I could, better than I want to. 

I know I’m still just a girl. 
I know you never thought of me 
as much as I thought of you. 

Can we at least be friends now? 
You haven’t talked to me since May. 
I miss your smile, your glances. 

I promise you won’t have to break your own heart
because of me. 
I’m not much of a heartbreaker anyway. 






<span class="poemtitle">fake</span>
<span class="poemdate">6.24.19</span>

The music and laughter hit me, hard and cold, in the face.
I tried to turn around but couldn’t,
so I stayed there, frozen amid the cacophony of noises.
My own throat felt too tight,
my laugh too loud,
eyes too tired.






<span class="poemtitle">seventeen</span>
<span class="poemdate">6.24.19</span>

She still hasn’t kissed a boy
or held someone’s hand
or been to a concert
or had a sleep-over.
But finally
she knows who she is
and that’s enough.






<span class="poemtitle">claire</span>
<span class="poemdate">6.25.19</span> 

she wears the stars on her fingers like jewelry
and sings like the milky way
her eyes closed
a heartbeat in her voice

she glows like the moon
and walks barefoot through meteor showers
and paints the sky
a different color every day






<span class="poemtitle">paris</span>
<span class="poemdate">7.7.19</span>

Twinkling lights.
Shattered colors.
A clump of people.
Sculpted marble.
Dirty streets.
The rush of a metro.
Lovely stone.
A beautiful arch.
A strange tower.
Gardens at dusk.






<span class="poemtitle">amsterdam</span>
<span class="poemdate">7.7.19</span> 

the sky is a smear of silver and gray
leaking with a slow, heavy heat
a weary quiet 
stretches along the canals
buildings tilt like books on a shelf
resting contentedly against each other
like old friends






<span class="poemtitle">dreams</span>
<span class="poemdate">8.15.19</span> 

she wakes up screaming.
hands too close
thoughts too fast
breath too hot.
memories that are supposed to be buried.
but here they are.
she stays awake as long as she can.
if sleep does not hold solace,
what does?






<span class="poemtitle">ground control</span>
<span class="poemdate">8.25.19</span>

“Earth to Amy,” she says
But she doesn’t know that I’m already here.
I’m grounded.  
I’m more earthed than I ever wanted to be. 






<span class="poemtitle">orange peels</span>
<span class="poemdate">6.24.20</span>

The ends of her hairs are split,
too scraggly for her mother’s taste.
She licks the sticky sweetness of oranges from her fingers
and smiles as her face freckles and burns,
sand stuck to her skin and in her clothes.
The wind steals a kite from a nearby boy,
and up and down the beach there are shouts of laughter
and the incessant chatter of seagulls.
She adds another orange peel to her pile
and rejoices in the messiness of it all.






<span class="poemtitle">rush hour</span>
<span class="poemdate">6.27.20</span>

The words are a traffic jam in the back of my throat.
A pile of gridlock.
I swallow hard and keep my mouth shut.






<span class="poemtitle">thanksgiving</span>
<span class="poemdate">11.29.20</span>

He shouldn’t have felt so pulled apart
tugged in separate directions by his two families—
the one that created him
the one he created
Why could they not see eye to eye
and why was he the one in the center
the unwanted voice
the mediator that absorbed frustration from all sides
He could feel the rift
splitting beneath his feet 
despite his every effort
Please, don’t make me choose, he pled
Please don’t make me pick a side.
He wept as he tried to hold it all together.






<span class="poemtitle">battles</span>
<span class="poemdate">12.29.20</span>

All I’m saying is that your soul must be worth an awful lot 
if heaven and hell are waging such a war over it. 






<span class="poemtitle">backyard</span>
<span class="poemdate">4.15.21</span>

the cherries are delicious but tricky
because no matter how hard you try, there always
seem to be worms. mom spends hours cutting
each cherry in half to remove them, but sometimes 
you just go ahead and eat them because you figure
a little extra protein never hurt anyone
and besides, you can’t even taste them

the peaches are best straight from the tree
still warm from the sun
unpeeled, leaving your lips itchy from the fuzz.
disagree if you want, but if that’s not how you eat them
then there is no way to flash back
to the late summer days with bare feet
and tangled hair and grass stains on knees






<span class="poemtitle">anger</span>
<span class="poemdate">4.16.21</span>

WHAT IS THIS SQUEEZING IN MY CHEST
WHY DO MY WORDS SEEM TO BYPASS MY BRAIN
AND HOW IS IT THAT I FEEL LIKE CRYING






<span class="poemtitle">july</span>
<span class="poemdate">6.6.21</span>

the clocks are screaming
the sunsets run in triangles
heart stuck inside my head
i can’t touch anything with these fingertips made of clouds
and gold is my new sad color






<span class="poemtitle">retornada</span>
<span class="poemdate">3.31.23</span>

She’s lying on her kitchen floor
There is a microwave out in the driveway 
and a new weight in her chest
while her mind falls over like dominoes






<span class="poemtitle">juana</span>
<span class="poemdate">3.31.23</span> 

When she remembers her country, her heart aches
But then she hears the echo of her crying baby 
and the angry voices searching them out
and the sky-scratching tension of fingers on triggers

and she vows never to return. 

Her children beg for a house instead of this old trailer.
She closes her eyes and drags in a deep breath,
praying to Papa Dios for a cool breeze of paciencia 
to clear her mind of the clutter.






<span class="poemtitle">left</span>
<span class="poemdate">7.3.23</span>

Your heart is unexpectedly intact
Still drumming on like the marching band
But your mind is shattered
The way the glass bowl broke when you were seven
Some pieces are big enough to make sense of
Others are no more than dust
Fated to be swept up by the broom and tossed aside forever.
You didn’t think their leaving you could do such a thing.






<span class="poemtitle">a tranquil backyard wedding reception</span>
<span class="poemdate">7.7.23</span>

the hand that flies is a mere cherry on top of the verbal battering 
that continues on and on as the car moves innocently forward 
a continuation of years upon years upon years of intangible pain
heaped onto her soul, shoved between her ribs 
and down her esophagus and into her ears
her heart is twisted and clenched and silently weeping in the back seat
as she holds it all inside
tensing her whole self against the slow, painful ripping of her spirit
every nerve on high alert
every breath tighter and tighter
every muscle holding the pressure of the sobs she will not let out

she will not. 
let. 
them. 
out. 

but something cracks
and claws its way up her throat and tears out of her mouth
primal and wounded
she has never heard a human make a noise like that before
so raw and browbeaten and desperate
the car rolls along, course unchanged
outside world unaware of the splintering that just happened inside of her

her face presses against the window as she tries to remember how to breathe
every sob is an earthquake 
she cannot suck in enough oxygen
and there is a hollow stinging in her chest

time comes down with a bought of paralysis
everything frozen in gasping, screaming stillness
she feels unrecognizable
sitting in such a familiar place
with the most familiar people
intercessory words are spoken 
but they don’t fit in among the jagged fragments of her mind
as they keep driving, driving
how is it okay that they are still driving?
onward, onward, onward

until the car parks
and the hollowness encages her
she wipes the tears from her eyelashes
wrestles a breath into her aching lungs
opens the door
puts on her congratulations-I’m-so-happy-for-you face
there are cousins and uncles and aunts
sunflowers and blue ribbons
little party sandwiches and ice cream
I’m doing good how are you! 
tumbles so emptily from her teeth
but no one questions it
and in the family photos it won’t even look like a single tear has been shed.






<span class="poemtitle">god</span>
<span class="poemdate">10.16.23</span>

You wonder about God
Who and where and why
Was it just words they said
And justifications they made

And I suppose I’ve wondered too
And sometimes wonder still
But the periwinkle skies
The spiced autumn air
The morning sun breaking through my window
A mother’s embrace
A good friend’s laugh
My lungs bursting after a run
The light in my soul after teaching a lesson
The joy of family
The pain I have felt turn to healing

It is too good to be coincidence
Too beautiful to be an accident

His hand is in the details 
And I see His face
In you
In me
In all of us
We are a family, this world
Dysfunctional at times, yes
But a family
And that’s how I know who God is.
