        <p>
        So, how is it that an information systems major has a secret love for words? For poetry, even? It all goes way way back to a book that my mom coincidentally bought when I was a little girl: Poetry For Young People: Emily Dickinson. I read that book over and over, cover to cover. Something about the rhythm of the words and the images that they created in my mind captivated me. I could see Emily, I could feel what she felt, and I felt like somehow, she understood a small part of me that no one else did. I also discovered that I had a knack for memorizing words, and to this day I could probably recite a few of Emily Dickinson’s poems if asked. 
        <br><br>
        When I was a little older, I started writing my own poems. I remember sitting outside on a pile of autumn leaves with a piece of paper and pencil, scribbling rhymes that came to mind, my mom watching from the back door with a smile on her face. Were my poems any good? Probably not. But they were meaningful to me as I did my eight-year-old best of expressing deeper feelings in a special way.
        <br><br>
        Around the same time, I fell in love with reading. I hungrily read as many books as I could, from historical fiction to fantasy to romance. Nothing excited me more than curling up on the couch with a good book in hand and nothing to stop me from reading until late in the night. I think there were several times my mom had to gently shake me awake and softly pry the book out of my hands when I had fallen asleep in the middle of a chapter, well past midnight.
        <br><br>
        Words took other forms for me as well, and I found even more power in the lyrics of the music that I listened to and the songs that I sang as part of a community choir. Few things can match the combination of beautiful lyrics coupled with beautiful music.
        <br><br>
        My exploration of words continued as I took creative writing classes, participated in writing bootcamps, built habits of journaling and personal writing, and even started learning other languages like French and Spanish. I started paying closer attention to the effect of words on my own emotions and relationships, and looked for inspiration, creativity, and solace in music, dialogues, movies, books, and anywhere else I could find. Here are some of my favorites:
